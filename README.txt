*PROTOTYPE*

main.py: ACQUIRED EEG DATA VIA OpenVibe LSL AND SENDS PERIODIC ARDUINO STIMULI VIA PIN 13.  

testing.py: RECIEVES INPUT STIMULI FROM OPENVIBE. SAVES TIMES WHEN LABELS ARE SENT. TOBII RECIEVES A RISING EDGE AS '16' AND FALLING AS '0'. 
		SAMPLE DATA (OUTPUT) CAN BE FOUND IN /test_data


THIS PROJECT IS INTENDED FOR DATA SYNCHRONIZATION BETWEEN OpenVibe BCI PLATFORM 
AND Tobii EYETRACKER SYSTEM VIA 9-PIN CONNECTOR. IT USES ARDUINO TO SEND PERIODIC 
STIMULI TO Tobii WHILE ANOTHER PROCESS CALLS FOR EEG DATA.
